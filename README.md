# UNIVERSITY IDENTITY CARD APP
I am trying to develop a mobile application for the “University Student Identity Card” which can replace the printed version.
This application contains additional features than general one.
-	When there is a change of a student information made in the real time database which will simultaneously reflect in the mobile application.
-	QR and barcode in the application shall facilitate information sharing and authentication where the app is synced with the real time database.
-	Application contains an option for information sharing which enables the students to share their details to another party in the form of multi-media and messaging applications.
-	Students can install & login the application in Android devices which will reduce the occurrences for Identity cards lost.

# SETTING UP THE SYSTEM
-	Pull the source code and open it through Android Studio.
-	Project has some opensource dependencies and hence internet connection is required for initial gradle build
-	Repository contains an APK which can be used for further review.
-	Firebase is used in the app as a back-end database which is structured as below;

         users--|
                |--authentication id
                    |--Name
                    |--Mail
                    |--profile pic
                    |--signature
                    |--Registration No
                    |--NIC   
Note: Own database can be created using the above structure.
